Description: This package contains functions to conduct a seasonal adjustment of daily time series using the dsa2 procedure. The dsa2 builds on the the dsa procedure developed by Ollech (2021), but adds further features and a quicker implementation, as it uses routines implemented in Java / JDemetra+3.
